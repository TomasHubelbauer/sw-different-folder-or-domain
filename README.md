# Service Worker JavaScript to TypeScript Transpiler Demo

[**DEMO**](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/sw-js-to-ts-transpiler-demo)

This is a demo repository for the [Service Worker JavaScript to TypeScript Transpiler script](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/sw-js-to-ts-transpiler).

## To-Do

Find out why the JSX/TSX compilation is not working.

See if it will be possible to use ESM to import React and React DOM or if scripts tags will be needed.

Refresh the page the first time it is accessed and remember that in a cookie or local storage so that
the `script` tag is executed even on the first (after refresh) visit.
It is not registered on the first visit.

Finalize the React demo.
