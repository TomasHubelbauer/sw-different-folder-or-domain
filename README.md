# Service Worker JavaScript to TypeScript Transpiler Demo

[**DEMO**](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/sw-js-to-ts-transpiler-demo)

This is a demo repository for the [Service Worker JavaScript to TypeScript Transpiler script](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/sw-js-to-ts-transpiler).

To run locally run:

- `npm install` to install React & ReactDOM type definitions and `serve`
- `npm start` to serve the directory on `localhost:5000`

(The `file://` protocol is insecure and service workers require `localhost` or HTTPS.)
