# Service Worker JavaScript to TypeScript Transpiler Demo

[**DEMO**](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/sw-js-to-ts-transpiler-demo)

This is a demo repository for the [Service Worker JavaScript to TypeScript Transpiler script](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/sw-js-to-ts-transpiler).

To run locally use `npx serve .` (`file://` protocol is insecure and service workers require `localhost` or HTTPS).

## To-Do

Find out why the JSX/TSX compilation is not working.

See if it will be possible to use ESM to import React and React DOM or if scripts tags will be needed.

Finalize the React demo.
